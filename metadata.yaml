description: Mr. Bangs has caught the spirit of the ""Christmas Carols, "" and phrased
  it in his own style, so well liked in America. Not in a long time have we had Christmas
  stories so good as ""The Conversion of Hetherington, """"The Child Who Had Everything
  But ..., "" ""Santa Claus and Little Billie, "" and ""The House of the Seven Santas,
  ""--The four stories in this volume. Mr. Bangs' sense of humor never fails, his
  diction is well liked, and in these tales he has woven a strain of pathos which
  is not unfitting.
